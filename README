A quick and dirty Cataloginator.

What it is?
Exports your Calibre2 library to a list in a single html file, so you can put it everywhere.
Supports searching.
Has on screen cyrillic keyboard, so you don't have to hack your Kindle. Using it is still a mess.
TODO: Fix that.
It doesn't have any interface.
TODO: Stick some GUI.

But I acctually use it.
